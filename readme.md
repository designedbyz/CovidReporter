# Covid Reporter

Covid Reporter is a simple app for displaying top information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the New York Times. It consumes the times search API.

Future improvements will include loading articles based off of location.

#### notes
Covid Reporter makes use of a standard Dagger setup, and Kotlin for the code. The architecture, while still in its infancy, will generally follow the patterns encouraged by Clean Architecture.
